# NumPy Practice & Hands-On Learning

This repository showcases my structured and hands-on learning journey with **NumPy**, focusing on building strong fundamentals through practice rather than rote memorization.

I worked through a wide range of problems — from basic array operations to advanced concepts like **broadcasting, vectorization, memory views, and stride tricks** — to gain a deep understanding of how NumPy works internally.

##  Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a **strong foundation in NumPy**
- Develop a **problem-solving mindset**
- Prepare for **data analysis and machine learning workflows**
- Maintain a clean, well-documented reference for future projects

This repository reflects consistent practice, debugging, and learning by doing — skills essential for real-world data roles.
